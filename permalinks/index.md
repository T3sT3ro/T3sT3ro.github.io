- [factorio prototype waypoint belt building](factorio-prototype-waypoint-belts) - a prototype tool for building waypoint-based belt systems in factorio (like tracks on PCB boards).
- [factorio mods](factorio-mods) - List of my factorio mods and their pages with links to github repositories.
- [thesis: SDF manipulator in unity](unity-thesis-sdf-manipulator) - my bachelor thesis project, 2nd place (ex-aquo) for the best thesis award on University of Wroc≈Çaw - a tool for manipulating signed distance fields (SDF) in Unity. AFAIK first of it's kind (although prototype) to generate readable shaders, fully customizable, with HLSL syntax tree (custom implementation of syntax API!) and treat other SDFs as first-class citizens (think function composition). Also [the thesis itself](https://ii.uni.wroc.pl/media/uploads/2024/12/01/uwr-28-inz-62831-204930.pdf).
