# intentions:
#   - simple way to set limits
#   - simple way to order
#   - simply set profiles to run
#   - minimal syntax needed
#   - copy-paste summary from generator and have a mostly working config
#   - match by glob -- I see no real advantage for regex

# Default configuration runs named tests first and numbered tests last
# By default all tests are included
# default:
#  - '**' : 1m

# Profiles. 'default' is applied if no profile was present in command line
# A profile is a name with ordered list of tests filters with limits
default:
  # limit as <num>{m}?s for time and <num>{kmg}?b for memory
  # Match tests by globbing expression (see https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
  # To run all tests use <**> glob
  # Only matching tests will be run
  # Tests are matched top to bottom
