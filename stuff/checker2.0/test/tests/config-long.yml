# All names are matched as regex. Effective is last most-specific regex
# i.e. the last one among all matching pattern the most
# for example "PASSING" fits all ".*", "ING" and "PASSING" rules, but

timeouts:
    # .*: 5s       #default - matches all tests
    NON_EXISTENT: 3s
    FAILING: 2s
    PASSING: 1s
    OTHER: 1s
    OTHER/SLEEP: 1s

# order of tests to run
# PLAIN_TEXT to match all files CONTAINING keyword
# /REGEX/ to match file against regex
order:
    - ^PASSING
    - ^OTHER
    - ^FAILING
